  - step: "pose-adjustment"
    action:
      - extend both arms forward toward the viewer
      - rotate both palms to face directly toward the camera

    constraints:
      forbidden:
        - altering facial expression
        - modifying outfit
        - adding props or new items
        - introducing glow or VFX

        alignment:
          - all surfaces share the same center
          - all surfaces are parallel to the camera plane
          - no curvature or spherical distortion
        forbidden:
          - outline-only shapes
          - hollow frames
          - hexagonal shapes
          - domed or warped surfaces

          edge: "transparent orange"
        glow:
          - strong center luminosity
          - soft bloom
