subject: >
  Use the same character as reference A.
  Preserve all facial features, hairstyle, clothing, body proportions, colors,
  line weight, shading, and art style exactly as in the reference.

composition: >
  IMPORTANT: Change the framing from the reference.
  The camera must be positioned **much farther away** so the character’s entire body
  is fully visible **with extra space above, below, and around** the character.
  The character must appear **significantly smaller** than in reference A,
  occupying only about **20–30% of the frame height**.
  Place the character exactly at the center of the frame with wide open space
  surrounding them for later energy effects.
  The field of view should be noticeably wider than the reference.
  The final image must be rendered in a **16:9 aspect ratio**.

action: >
  Set the character in the awakening stance shown in reference B:
    - feet shoulder-width apart
    - both hands tightly clenched into fists
    - arms slightly bent and tense
    - chest slightly forward, posture firm and braced
    - intense, focused expression

location: >
  Reuse the same background environment as reference A.
  Expand the visible portion of the background **significantly**
  to match the widened, zoomed-out framing.
  Maintain the same textures, perspective, colors, and drawing style.

style: >
  Match the exact style of reference A:
  identical linework, shading, coloring, and background rendering.

camera_lighting: >
  Use the same lighting conditions as in reference A.

edit_instructions: >
  Recreate the character and background from reference A exactly.
  BUT modify the camera distance so the entire character fits in the frame
  with **substantial space** around them.
  The camera should be pulled back enough that the character appears small
  within a much wider environment.
  Change only:
    - the camera distance (strong zoom out)
    - the character’s pose, matching reference B exactly
  Everything else (design, colors, style, background identity) must remain consistent.
  Ensure the final output respects the **16:9 aspect ratio**.

references:
  A: >
    Use reference A for character identity, background style, line weight,
    coloring, and artistic consistency.
    Do NOT keep the original framing; replace it with a **wide, zoomed-out, full-body framing**.
  B: >
    Use reference B strictly to match the awakening pose:
      - shoulder-width stance
      - clenched fists
      - tense arms
      - forward, determined posture

extras: >
  high resolution, clean and consistent output, wide framing,
  **16:9 aspect ratio**.

【力の解放プロンプト】
subject:
  description: >
    The main character from the reference image, preserved exactly with identical
    proportions, facial features, outfit, and art style.
  action: >
    The character stands at the exact center of a fully enclosing spherical energy field.

composition:
  framing: >
    The sphere completely surrounds the character and remains fully or mostly visible
    within a wide 16:9 cinematic framing.
  aspect_ratio: "16:9"

action:
  primary: >
    A perfectly round, glowing spherical energy field fully encloses the character.
    The sphere’s surface is semi-transparent to clearly show the character inside.
  secondary: >
    The ground directly beneath the character is carved out in a concave, bowl-shaped
    form that precisely matches the inner curvature of the sphere.
  destruction_detail: >
    Only the environment that intersects with the sphere should be damaged or displaced.
    Cracks, fragments, and debris must follow the exact circular arc of the sphere.

location:
  description: >
    Preserve the original background style, perspective, color palette, and linework.
  deformation: >
    Deform only the area touched by the sphere. All other parts of the scene remain
    unchanged and loyal to the reference image.

style:
  consistency: >
    Maintain the reference image’s art style, shading, line weight, and coloring.
  effects: >
    Integrate the energy effects naturally without altering the character’s or
    background's visual identity.

camera_lighting:
  camera_angle: >
    Use the same camera angle and viewpoint as the reference image unless specified.
  lighting: >
    Add internal glow, rim light, and soft light diffusion from the spherical energy.

colors:
  palette: >
    Energy sphere uses bright electric-blue or user-chosen colors with lightning-like
    patterns and high contrast.

text: none

edit_instructions: >
    Add a fully enclosing spherical energy field around the character while preserving
    the original style. Ensure the sphere covers the character entirely — above, behind,
    and around them. Modify only surfaces the sphere touches, sculpting the ground into
    a concave bowl shape consistent with the sphere’s curvature. Do not modify any other
    part of the image.

references:
  A: Main reference for character, style, and background.
  B: Optional reference for energy sphere design.

extras:
  quality: "ultra-quality rendering, detailed energy patterns"
  resolution: "high"
  effects: "volumetric glow, electric arcs, internal illumination"
