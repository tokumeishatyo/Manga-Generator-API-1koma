subject: >
  Create a dynamic battle-scene layout featuring:
  (1) an SD-style 16-bit pixel-art battle sprite based on Reference A,
  (2) a close-up cut-in portrait from Reference A placed within an
      energy-defined diagonal highlight area,
  (3) a pixel-art face icon for the dialogue window.
  All representations must depict the same character.

composition: >
  16:9 cinematic battle layout with:
  - left side: a diagonal energy-defined cut-in area,
  - right side: an SD pixel sprite,
  - top: technique-name window,
  - bottom: dialogue window with face icon.

  **Orientation rules:**
    • The SD pixel sprite must face left.
    • The SD sprite must match the pose, gesture, silhouette,
      and body posture shown in Reference A, translated into pixel art.
    • The cut-in portrait preserves its original facing direction
      from Reference A exactly (no correction or reinterpretation).
    • Do NOT tilt, rotate, flip, mirror, or redirect the portrait.
    • Do NOT adjust gaze or head direction toward the center.

  **Energy-defined diagonal cut-in (CRITICAL):**
    • The cut-in area is defined entirely by ENERGY EFFECTS.
    • Do NOT draw geometric borders or frames.
      (No rectangles, no polygons, no trapezoids, no border lines.)
    • Use glowing energy, lightning, streaks, beams, or aura
      to clearly separate the cut-in from the background.
    • Create a diagonal slicing boundary angled ~15–20 degrees.
    • Only the energy boundary is angled.
    • The portrait from Reference A must remain upright and unaltered.
    • Inside the cut-in area, use energy effects only.

  **SD pixel sprite:**
    • Positioned on the right.
    • 16-bit retro pixel-style rendering.
    • Must replicate the pose of Reference A (body angle, arm/leg positions).
    • Left-facing orientation enforced.
    • Background inferred from the setting of Reference A.
    • No global speed lines.

  **Technique-name window:**
    • Top-center overlay (approx. 60% width, 10% height).

  **Dialogue window:**
    • Bottom overlay (approx. 90% width, 18% height).
    • Pixel-art face icon (~12% width) on the left.
    • Japanese text on the right.

action: >
  The SD sprite performs a left-facing pre-attack pose matching
  the stance from Reference A.
  The diagonal energy-defined cut-in displays a close-up portrait
  of the same character with energetic visual effects.

location: >
  SD-side background approximated from Reference A.
  Cut-in region uses only abstract energy effects.

style: >
  - SD sprite: 16-bit retro pixel-art.
  - Cut-in: portrait from Reference A with no stylistic changes.
  - Energy-defined diagonal visual separation.
  - Futuristic UI windows with blue, metallic, cyan accents.
  - No full-screen speed lines.

camera_lighting: >
  Pixel-style shading on the SD sprite.
  Strong rim-glow along the diagonal energy boundary.
  Do not modify the portrait’s lighting or anatomy.

colors: >
  Portrait colors preserved completely from Reference A.
  Energy effects: bright electric tones (yellow, blue, white, etc).
  UI colors: blue, metallic grey, cyan.

text:
  attack_name: "ここに技名を入力"
  dialogue: "ここにセリフを入力"

edit_instructions: >
  Use the portrait from Reference A exactly as provided.
  Preserve its original pose, facing direction, expression, and lighting.
  Do NOT rotate, flip, or adjust the portrait.
  Crop to a close-up of the face or face+shoulders.

  Construct a diagonal cut-in region using ONLY energy effects.
  No geometric frames or polygonal shapes.
  The diagonal energy boundary must appear at 15–20 degrees.
  Insert the upright portrait into this energy-defined area.

  Create the SD pixel sprite:
    - must match the pose, gesture, and orientation of Reference A,
      converted faithfully into 16-bit pixel art,
      facing left.
  Create the pixel-art face icon.

  Assemble with technique-name window and dialogue window.
  No enemies and no full-screen speed lines.

references:
  A: Character reference image
  B: Optional UI reference images

extras: >
  Add energy glow along the diagonal boundary.
  Layer hierarchy:
    SD background → energy-cut-in → SD sprite → UI → text.
