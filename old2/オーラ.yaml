task: "edit-image: transform character into an awakened golden-aura form"

base_image: |
  Use the provided reference illustration as the base.
  Keep the character’s identity, facial features, body type, and overall proportions.
  Preserve the original outfit design and color scheme, including clothing details,
  accessories, and any mechanical or decorative elements.
  Do not add new characters or change the general scene setting.

pose_change: |
  Change the character’s pose into a powerful awakened stance.
  Make the character stand in a strong, grounded full-body pose:
  feet apart, body slightly leaning forward, fists clenched at the sides or slightly away from the body,
  chest lifted, head raised with an intense, determined expression.
  The pose should clearly suggest that the character is releasing a huge amount of power.

hair_transformation: |
  Transform the character’s hair into a golden awakened form.
  Change the hair color to bright golden-yellow while keeping the original hair length
  and general hairstyle silhouette.
  Make the hair stand up and flare outward in sharp, energetic strands,
  as if charged with power and lifted by a strong aura.
  Keep the character recognizable as the same person, only with awakened golden hair.

aura_and_effects: |
  Make the character emit a powerful golden energy aura from the entire body.
  Surround the character with a bright, flame-like golden aura that radiates outward,
  with layered waves of light, drifting energy particles, and subtle shockwave rings in the air.
  Emphasize upward and outward motion in the aura, as if power is constantly surging from the body.
  Let the aura cast strong golden highlights and rim light on the character and nearby areas.
  Do not add lightning or electric arcs unless explicitly requested.

style: |
  Preserve the original illustration style, rendering quality, and level of detail.
  Do not change the overall art style or line work.
  The main changes are the awakened pose, the golden awakened hair, and the golden energy aura,
  all integrated naturally into the existing scene.

constraints: |
  Do not alter the character’s face shape, eye shape, or key design motifs of the outfit.
  Do not change the background drastically; keep the original environment recognizable.
  Do not add weapons, armor, or large new objects that were not in the reference,
  unless they are already part of the character’s design.
  Focus the edit on the awakened pose, hair transformation, and full-body aura only.
