# Step 5: Angle & Zoom Change (角度・ズーム変更)
# Purpose: Transform front pose to different camera angles and zoom levels
# Input: Front pose image from Step4 + Outfit three-view sheet from Step3
type: angle_transform
title: "左向き2"
author: "Unknown"

# Input Images
# ====================================================
input:
  front_pose_image: "まゆみ波動拳.png"
  outfit_three_view_sheet: "彩瀬まゆみスポーツ.png"
  purpose: "Change camera angle while STRICTLY freezing the character's pose."

# Reference Guidance (三面図による補完)
reference_guidance:
  outfit_sheet: "彩瀬まゆみスポーツ.png"
  usage: "Use standard three-view to reconstruct unseen angles."
  constraints:
    - "Back design MUST match the back view of the sheet."
    - "Side details MUST match the side view of the sheet."
    - "Do NOT invent details not present in the reference."

constraints:
  character_preservation:
    # ポーズを絶対に維持するための超重要指示
    - "CRITICAL: The character is FROZEN in the specific pose from 'front_pose_image'. Do NOT change the pose."
    - "Keep exact positions of bent arms, hands, legs, and body twist relative to the character's own axis."
    - "The ONLY thing changing is the camera's viewpoint around the static subject."
  angle_reconstruction:
    # 三面図による補完指示
    - "Seamlessly reconstruct unseen parts (back, sides, top) referring STRICTLY to 'outfit_three_view_sheet'."
    - "Ensure consistent lighting and shadows corresponding to the new camera angle."
  camera:
    - "Apply camera angle: Camera moves to the character's direct LEFT side (90 degrees). A full profile view showing the left side of the face, body, and the specific configuration of the bent left arm and leg in the static pose."
    - "Apply zoom level: Full body shot, entire figure visible from head to toe"

anti_hallucination:
  - "Do NOT straighten limbs."
  - "Do NOT alter facial expression."
  - "Do NOT invent details absent in the reference sheet."
