# Step 5: Angle & Zoom Change (角度・ズーム変更)
# Purpose: Transform front pose to different camera angles and zoom levels
# Input: Front pose image from Step4 + Outfit three-view sheet from Step3
type: angle_transform

# Input Images
# ====================================================
input:
  front_pose_image: "まゆみ波動拳.png"
  outfit_three_view_sheet: "彩瀬まゆみスポーツ.png"
  purpose: "Reconstruct character from front pose to different angle using three-view as reference"

# Reference Images for angle reconstruction
reference_guidance:
  outfit_sheet: "彩瀬まゆみスポーツ.png"
  usage: "Use the three-view sheet to accurately reconstruct side/back views"
  constraints:
    - "Side view clothing details should match the side view in outfit_sheet"
    - "Back view should match the back view in outfit_sheet"
    - "Maintain consistent character design across all angles"

# ====================================================
# Camera Settings
# ====================================================
camera:
  angle: "←左向き"
  angle_prompt: "Character rotated 90 degrees to their LEFT, showing LEFT PROFILE (left side of face visible), character's nose pointing to the LEFT edge of the image"
  zoom: "全身"
  zoom_prompt: "Full body shot, entire figure visible from head to toe"

# ====================================================
# Output Settings
# ====================================================
output:
  background: "pure white, clean background"
  format: "single character image at specified angle and zoom"

# Constraints (Critical)
# ====================================================
constraints:
  character_preservation:
    - "MUST preserve exact character identity from front_pose_image"
    - "Maintain face, hair, clothing design exactly as shown"
    - "Keep pose (arm positions, leg positions) consistent with front pose"
  angle_reconstruction:
    - "Use outfit_three_view_sheet to reconstruct unseen parts"
    - "Side/back clothing details must match the three-view reference"
    - "Do NOT invent or hallucinate details not shown in references"
  camera:
    - "Apply camera angle: Character rotated 90 degrees to their LEFT, showing LEFT PROFILE (left side of face visible), character's nose pointing to the LEFT edge of the image"
    - "Apply zoom level: Full body shot, entire figure visible from head to toe"

anti_hallucination:
  - "Do NOT change character's face or expression"
  - "Do NOT modify clothing design or colors"
  - "Do NOT alter the pose from front_pose_image"
  - "Use ONLY information from the two input images"
  - "For unseen parts, refer ONLY to outfit_three_view_sheet"
